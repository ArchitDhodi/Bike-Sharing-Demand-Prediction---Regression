# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction---Regression

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. We have been given a dataset containing data on various factors that impact the usage of bike rental services. The main objective of this project is to understand the underlying trends and make prediction about the demand for bike rentals at different times. Our aim is also to identify the key factors that influence bike rental demand.
